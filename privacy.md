# I took privacy seriously – Why we need VPNs


I wrote about Whatsapp’s privacy policy changes recently and that was just one of shocking news that got me spend some time reading about user privilege, privacy, encryption and so on..
I started off researching about the effects of corporation surveillance on user data and ended up with articles on facebook Vs mental health - yes I also ended up re-watching that popular Netflix documentary. As I spent hours reading about it, I decided to put a pause and start learning about what can be done. 

## So… What’s a VPN?
Think of a software on your phone that connects to a computer every time you wish to access a website. You can use this computer as a “host” to search the web and forward all content to your device. This hides all your information, even the domain names from your ISP because it can only see that you are trying to access a computer dedicated to your VPN provider. This hides all your information your ISP along with providing anonymity in the ocean of hackers. The network packets embedded within the tunnels use different communication protocols to isolate the user data. These extra layers of security is beneficial to even secure networks. 

## VPN vs Incognito Mode
The famous incognito mode on Google Chrome enables users to privately browse the internet. When you’ve gone incognito the browser won’t store IP addresses, cookies, or any info you enter into a website that you visit. So, Incognito mode is only for our benefit to temporarily disable browsing history or getting better flight or hotel deals as websites don’t use cookies, unaware of your identity. Incognito modes cannot spoof your location or access blocked content in your region like VPNs do. And your ISP or employer can still track your activity. In fact, they don’t see any difference from normal browsing.
## VPN vs HTTPS
The secure Hypertext transfer protocol encrypts all the data sent from your browser to the internet. HTTP uses port 80 and all traffic from this port should be encrypted. But, there are other types of data being sent from your phone and that’s where VPN comes to rescue. It encrypts ALL data coming out of your device to the internet. 
Some VPN providers who tunnel the data from your device to the host (that special computer) may access internet from that point without using encryption. This does not guarantee security. On the other hand, using HTTPS cannot stop ISPs from tracking your data and location. So, this is not secure either. Hence, VPN cannot be a substitute for https and vice-versa. 
## VPN + HTTPS + DDG = you’re safe!
Virtual Private Networks are ultimately designed to protect the user and the user data by creating private network connection on an existing public network connection. VPNs use proxy servers and tunneling protocols to create secure channels over cellular and ethernet/wifi networks. We need VPNs to evade surveillance and access censored content or blocked content across the globe. We also need HTTPS to hide every sensitive data from hackers. Lastly, since most of our time is spent searching the internet for interesting content, we need a search engine that doesn’t store search history, IP address and cookies. DuckDuckGo (or DDG in short) is a pioneer of search engines that truly cares about user privacy.
