# TRANSITIONING TO PM ROLES FROM AN ENGINEERING BACKGROUND
There come that time in our lives when we need to transition from one carrier to another. But, most of the time, we don’t know what’s ahead of us till we leap. That’s what it is like from transitioning to PM roles from engineering.  
But they are several questions you must ask yourself when making such a big decision. What is project management? What are the qualities you’ll need to be a good product manager? Also, the steps you have to take when you’re making this transition.
## What is Product Management?
Product management deals with creating new a new product or improving an existing one in the market. It starts with an idea of the consumers' needs to evaluate the product's success.
Product management has to do with product developing, marketing and actualizing sales to the end-users or consumers.
## Qualities of a Good Product Manager
If you must fit into PM roles effectively, you must have good product management qualities outlined below.
•	The Ability to Prioritize
•	Good Communication Skills

## 4 Key Differences in Skills Engineer to Product Manager
There are no steep criteria in fitting into PM roles. You don’t need to have any engineering background like I had before you can succeed in product management roles.
Any dedicated individual can learn the basics of product development, software design, development lifecycle, marketing and sales. 
Outlined below are four fundamental elements that make PM roles different from engineering.
•	Product managing roles require strong empathy towards your customers both internally and externally.
•	PM roles require a sound understanding of the business and market.
•	In product managing roles, your goal is always to achieve business deals through excellent product initiatives. As a product manager, your role is to identify problems and validate such problems.
•	As a product manager, you’ll have to participate in every aspect of product development and marketing.
### What are the Company’s Expectations of a Product Manager?
In product managing roles, you need to understand that your core focus and goal is to deliver business outcomes. 
However, the expectation varies depending on the companies goals, team structure and business dynamics.
The companies expect you to focus on essential KPIs like revenue, product retention, team management and customer satisfaction.
The company expects a good product manager to drive strong cross-functional alignment that actualizes sales and ensures team members are focusing on the product's challenges.
A wise woman once said: The most complicated function of any business is great product management and, if carried out effectively, can transform the entire business.
Engineer vs. Product Manager Responsibilities
When you’re changing to a carrier like PM roles, you must know that the difference as a product manager is that you have to identify the product problems (technical, business, strategy or customer). You need to understand why such a challenge is worth solving or how it can lead to business success in the long haul. 
In contrast, engineering requires the engineer to deliver the solution to that problem. But PM roles demand more than solving problems because you need to consistently carry the entire team along to actualize the business goals.
A product manager will also play a part in the product roadmap, customer strategy, marketing, and sales.
That’s not all. For a product to be successful everyone has to collaborate as “one team”, so you should also be willing to roll up your sleeves for testing the product, designing the solution, providing quick feedback and documentation.
### How to Transition from Engineering to Product Management
Firstly, when making that transition from engineering to product management, you need to understand what product management is all about and your roles. 
It’s essential you know that every business, team and market is different from the other. To fit into PM roles, you have to start thinking like a product manager and not as an engineer.
You can improve yourself on product development, strategy and marketing, taking advantages of online training and books to sharpen your sense of responsibilities in PM roles.
Be willing to learn how to approach a problem, define the product problem, build a hypothesis around effective solutions and refining the team for the product success.
I will also recommend that you pair up with someone who is already a product manager so that you will get that hands-on experience.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, when transitioning from engineering to PM roles, you need to be willing to solve complex business problems. You have to look at the career as a marathon and not a sprint. 
Also, know that great products take time and learn new ideas and strategies every day. Like I always say, slow is smooth and smooth is fast.
