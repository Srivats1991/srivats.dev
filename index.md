## Hello!

Welcome to my personal website. I'm a Software Engineer working for a network security company in Texas. I'm currently interested in making a career transition to product management. Apart from work, I like to travel, read and of course... Netfix and chill. 

### Books

Here's a small list of books that have helped me think differently, influenced my life in a positive way or helped me get better understanding of concepts that I'm interested.

# Non-Fiction
