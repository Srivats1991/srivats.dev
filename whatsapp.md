# WhatsApp’s New Privacy Policy Changes Seem SCARY! 

This most popular messaging app received instant backlash from its users because WhatsApp claimed it would limit the available features for the users who won’t accept the policy changes. According to the platform’s new data sharing policy, the app collects plenty of user data and may share it on Facebook. 

However, WhatsApp did issue a clarification and delayed the new privacy policy, but the damage was already done. Users also believe that WhatsApp doesn’t encrypt the chats they back up on google drive and the cloud. Are you also planning to switch from WhatsApp to any other app? Here’s everything you need to keep in mind.

## Future of Messaging Apps: WhatsApp or Something New?

Security and privacy are no longer WhatsApp’s highest priority, and its updates have pushed many of the users to switch to a more up-to-date and secure platform. 
So what’s next? There are some great alternatives to WhatsApp; you may call them “Future of the World of Messaging”, for example, Signal and Telegram. However, I am much more in favour of “Signal” because of its exceptional security features. 

### Signal App has come to the Rescue!

Are you freaking out about WhatsApp’s privacy issues? Then switch to Signal as soon as you can. It is a widely held view that this app is exceptionally dedicated to cryptography and privacy. Moreover, the CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, urged people to use Signal and reject WhatsApp. He stated “Use Signal” after the WhatsApp vs Signal controversy.

Listed below are the key reasons why Signal has become my absolute favorite messaging platform

•	Secure and encrypted: Signal’s excellent privacy policy makes it the primary beneficiary of the Facebook-owned messaging app exodus. Its “disappearing messages” feature makes it more privacy-focused, and the custom notification feature makes sure that your messages are not visible on your lock screen. Furthermore, session verification verifies that a third party doesn’t intercept your sensitive conversations (messages or calls). 
•	Android, iOS, and desktop availability: Apart from its excellent privacy protocol, it offers all communication features (message, voice, and videos) on iOS, Android, and desktop if you have the app installed on your phone. 

•	Innovative features: 
1.	Use Signal with the help of “proxy support” if the app is blocked in your country. 
2.	The unique wallpapers make the chat more appealing.
3.	Group link and QR code make joining a group simpler. 

Status update and designing a wide variety of emoticons are the only necessary improvements. However, the management team of Signal is already working on some of them. 

Now the question is, which app is better? Signal or Telegram? Mentioned below are the main differences between these two platforms 

### Signal vs Telegram: the brighter future? 

•	A non-profit organization owns Signal, whereas a for-profit organization owns Telegram. However, both are free to use.  
•	Signal has self-destructed messaging for all chats, while in Telegram, only secret conversations are self-destructed. 
•	Signal is a bit more concerned about privacy than Telegram. Telegram has an end-to-end encryption option, but Signal encrypts every message by default. 
•	Signal is on 2nd rank while Telegram is ranked 7th in the most used messaging app rankings. 

### You’re Caught Up!

These were all the reasons to ditch the other apps and switch to Signal. Most importantly, this platform proves to be the better choice for people who value privacy.
