# Design Thinking Approach could transform organizations - Don't just restrict it PMs and Designers

Companies are knowingly or unknowingly want one thing - Products that people love. Every product in the market solves (or atleast tries!) customer problems. 
Design thinking in it's simplest terms in a human-centric approach that believes all problems, simple or complicated, ultimately are human. At it's core Design Thinking tries to understand the needs of customers, foster innovation and ultimately result in awesome products that makes people happy.
It shifts the focus towards understanding customer needs rather than starting off building products right at the beginning. 

## The 5 stage approach

Design thinking framework comes in different flavors. Different organizations optimize these models to suit their needs. But, largely Design Thinking approaches focus on customer needs and problems at the very beginning and postpone the solution space, which is building the product itself to the very end.

Stanford School has identified 5 stages of Design Thinking process. Let's briefly look at each of them below:

### Empathize 

Empathizing with customers helps us experience customer needs, problems and journey. This stage is designed to gain empathic understanding of the issues that needs to be addressed. And, this understanding is very important to discard the assumptions about users and their needs in general. 

Customers' thoughts, actions, words and feelings are observed and recorded to review it in later stages.

### Define

Once customer problems are understood, it's time to put all the information down on paper. Generally, this information assume the form of problem statement and user personas. 

Problem statements are defined to phrase problems from a user perspective rather than an aim or goals for the company. Design thinkers often try to align user problems with company goals to obtain a clear action item for Engineers at later stages.

User personas gives the information a human form - with a name, age and profession. This helps everyone in the team to picturize the human actually experiencing problems.

### Ideate

It's time to make a move towards solution space!

Problem statements and user personas generated from Define stage needs to be addressed. And, this has to be done creatively! It's best to spend time on generating ideas rather than obsessing about feasibility, quality and so on. Any such evaluations would not motivate thinkers to come up with creative ideas.

### Prototype

Thinkers will now have to design the solutions for problems.
