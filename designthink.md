# Design Thinking approach and why it is not just for designers

Companies are knowingly or unknowingly want one thing - Products that people love. Every product in the market solves (or atleast tries!) customer problems. 
Design thinking in it's simplest terms is a human-centric approach. It believes all problems, simple or complicated are ultimately human. At it's core, Design Thinking tries to understand the needs of customers, foster innovation and ultimately result in awesome products that makes people happy.

## The 5 stage approach

Design thinking framework comes in different flavors. Different organizations optimize these models to suit their needs. But, largely Design Thinking approaches focus on customer needs and problems at the very beginning and postpone the solution space, which is building the product itself to the very end.

Stanford School has identified 5 stages of Design Thinking process. Let's briefly look at each of them below:

### Empathize 

Empathizing with customers helps us experience customer needs, problems and journey. This stage is designed to gain empathic understanding of the issues that needs to be addressed. And, this understanding is very important to discard the assumptions about users and their needs in general. 

Customers' thoughts, actions, words and feelings are observed and recorded to review it in later stages.

### Define

Once customer problems are understood, it's time to put all the information down on paper. Generally, this information assume the form of problem statement and user personas. 

Problem statements are defined to phrase problems from a user perspective rather than an aim or goals for the company. Design thinkers often try to align user problems with company goals to obtain a clear action item for Engineers at later stages.

User personas gives the information a human form - with a name, age and profession. This helps everyone in the team to picturize the human actually experiencing problems.

### Ideate

It's time to make a move towards solution space!

Problem statements and user personas generated from Define stage needs to be addressed. And, this has to be done creatively! It's best to spend time on generating ideas rather than obsessing about feasibility, quality and so on. Any such evaluations would not motivate thinkers to come up with creative ideas.

### Prototype

Prototypes are simple scaled-down versions of products or features of a product. 

Thinkers would spend time to build prototypes of their solutions and the best solution would be constructed through active involvement of all the team members. The final prototype gives a testable product for users. 

### Test

Testing, testing, testing and .....testing!!

Congrats, your product (or a reduced version of it) is ready to be tested. This step crucial because we would have to go back to customers for testing and their feedback is important to know if your product solves problems, fix flaws when needed and improvise them.

## Be ready for change - Design Thinking is an iterative approach

Often times, your user personas might not look personal for other members in the team and few really good solutions might need refining to build workable prototypes. What we need to remember is that the 5 stage approach is not straighforward. At times, it's required to understand empathize, think creative solutions, build working prototypes and testing them with real users parallely. This might look clumsy or overwhelming and that is why we need to accept and address changes as they come. To our dismay, understanding problems and building solutions is messy during the research stage and get more focused when the prototypes are designed and tested. 

## So why just restrict it to PMs and Designers?

Design Thinking is all about being in touch with users and working on valuable feedbacks from them. Product Managers engage with customers to understand their needs and Designers spend time creating attractive prototypes that can be tested. However, many companies ignore the impact that Design approach would have among multi disciplinary teams. 

Design Thinking relies heavily on an innovative mindset and creative thinking. During the Ideation and Protoype stages, involving members from different backgrounds can certainly make an impact on the quality of the solution. 
If Designers rely on their intuition to understand customer thoughts, engineers rely on analytical approach to evaluate prototypes. 
While designers can explain "why" customers do what they do, engineers are better off explaining "how" to do it. 
Testers can evaluate limits and constraints on prototypes. 
Marketing folks can easily pitch in their thoughts on important features to be shipped based on competition in the field. 


## Final Word

For too long, there have been efforts by the leaders of tech companies to transform the culture by enabling cross collaboration of teams. Inolving multi-disciplinary teams during design thinking can not only improve the quality of the product, but in the longer run has the ability to grow a culture of "customer obsession" across the organization. This could offset to help the company in unimaginable ways if implemented properly.
